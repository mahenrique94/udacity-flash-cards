# Flash Cards
Project made to finish a third module in React Nanodregree program on Udacity.

## Requirements

- The app was tested and supported only iOS system

## Project dependencies
To do this project, was used some libraries, like:

1. expo
2. i18next
3. lodash
4. react
5. react-navigation
6. react-redux
7. redux
8. sort-by
9. eslint

Those are main libraries of the project.

## Setup
To init and configure the project it's very simple, there's a lot of scripts done for a better automatization tasks like those.

### Intall
The first necessary step is to install all project dependencies, you can just run on root source:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

Wait all while all dependencies are downloaded and configured.

### Start
After that first step has been done, you can start a development local server with:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

A development server will be started at your localhost laptop or computer.

### Start on iOS
After that first step has been done, you can start a development local server with:

```
yarn ios
```

or

```
npm run ios
```

A development server will be started at your localhost laptop or computer.


### ESLint
If you need check some code format, the project has been configured with ESLint, so you can check through:

```
yarn lint
```

or

```
npm lint
```

If some error was found, just run the same command with `lint:fix` to try fixed it.
